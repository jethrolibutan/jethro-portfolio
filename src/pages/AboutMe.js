          I am Jethro Libutan. I am a computer science student at East Carolina
          University. I enjoy creating software and bringing my ideas and
          other's ideas to life. Constantly immersed in both front-end and
          back-end development, I am dedicated to expanding my skill set and
          acquiring new knowledge. My aim is to become a versatile engineer,
          capable of navigating the complexities of both client-side and
          server-side development. My primary experience is mostly in full stack
          web applications. I also have experience in mobile development and
          marketing.
